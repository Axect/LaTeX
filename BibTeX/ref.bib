  abstract =     {We study three computer algebra systems, namely SageMath (with
                  SageManifolds package), Maxima (with ctensor package) and
                  Python language (with GraviPy module), which allow tensor
                  manipulation for general relativity calculations. We present
                  simple examples and give a benchmark of these systems. After
                  the general analysis, we focus on the SageMath+SageManifolds
                  system to analyze and visualize the solutions of the massless
                  Klein-Gordon equation and geodesic motion with Hamilton-Jacobi
                  formalism.},
